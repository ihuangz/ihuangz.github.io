Our results show prominent low P-wave velocity (low-Vp) anomalies under SE China which may reﬂect the remnant magma chambers and channels of the Late Mesozoic igneous rocks, which may be reheated by the upwelling mantle ﬂow from the lower mantle driven by the deep subduction in East Asia during the Cenozoic. High-Vp anomalies are revealed in the upper mantle to the east of Taiwan, which represent the subducted Eurasian plate. Our result also suggests the break-off of the subducted Eurasian plate caused by its interaction with the Philippine Sea plate under Central and North Taiwan. The slab break-off may have created a mantle window through which the asthenospheric ﬂow arises, causing the high heat ﬂow and rapid uplift in the Taiwan orogen.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the shear-wave splitting at 138 permanent seismograph stations to study seismic anisotropy and mantle dynamics under Mainland China. To obtain reliable results we used three different methods to measure the shear-wave splitting parameters using core phases (SKS, SKKS, SKiKS and PKS) as well as the direct S waves from regional and distant earthquakes. Our results show that the fast orientations of the anisotropy (WNW–ESE) in eastern China are generally consistent with the absolute plate motion (APM) direction of the Eurasian plate, suggesting that the anisotropy is mainly located in the asthenosphere resulting from the lattice-preferred orientation of olivine due to the shear deformation there. The fast axes in western China generally agree with the strikes of the orogens and active faults, while they are perpendicular to the direction of the maximum horizontal stress, suggesting that the anisotropy in the lithosphere contributes signiﬁcantly to the observed shear-wave splitting. The fast axes in western China are also consistent with the APM direction, suggesting that the APM-driven anisotropy in the asthenosphere is another source of the shear-wave splitting there. These results suggest that APM-driven anisotropy commonly exists under continents, similar to that under oceanic regions, even though the continental lithosphere has suffered extensive deformation.},

	abstract = {We determined P- and S-wave tomography and P-wave anisotropic structure under the Honshu arc from the Japan Trench to the backarc area under the Japan Sea using 310 749 P- and 150 563 S-wave arrivals from 4655 local earthquakes recorded by 982 seismograph stations. Arrival times from 1451 suboceanic earthquakes relocated with sP depth phases enable us to determine the structures under the Paciﬁc Ocean and Japan Sea, which expand the study region from the land area to the whole arc from the Japan Trench to the Japan Sea with a width of more than 500 km. The results show strong heterogeneities above the subducting Paciﬁc slab under the Paciﬁc Ocean and most large thrust-type earthquakes occurred in the high-velocity areas where the Paciﬁc slab and the overriding continental plate may be strongly coupled. Low-velocity (low-V ) zones are imaged in the mantle wedge with signiﬁcant along-arc variations under the volcanic front. The mantle-wedge low-V zone extends westwards under the Japan Sea and it is connected with the subducting Paciﬁc slab at depths of 150–200 km under the backarc. The results indicate that the H2O and ﬂuids brought downwards by the subducting Paciﬁc slab are released into the mantle wedge by dehydration and are subsequently transported to the surface by the upwelling ﬂow in the mantle wedge. Signiﬁcant P-wave anisotropic anomalies are revealed under the Honshu arc. The predominant fast velocity direction (FVD) is E–W in the mantle wedge while it is N–S in the subducting Paciﬁc slab. The anisotropy in the mantle wedge is the result of deformation caused by the subduction of the Paciﬁc plate and the induced mantle-wedge convection, while the FVD pattern in the middle of the mantle wedge argues for the 3-D mantle ﬂow or the speciﬁc alignment of the olivine in the partial-melting mantle. The N–S (trench-parallel) FVD in the subducting Paciﬁc slab represents either the original fossil anisotropy when the Paciﬁc plate formed or the trench-parallel crystallographic and shaped preferred orientation in the subducting slab due to the slab bending. The present results shed new light on the structural heterogeneities and seismic anisotropy under the Honshu arc, which may improve our understanding of the dynamic processes of subduction zones.},

	abstract = {We have made great efforts to collect and combine a large number of high-quality data from local earthquakes and teleseismic events recorded by the dense seismic networks in both South Korea and West Japan. This is the ﬁrst time that a large number of Korean and Japanese seismic data sets are analyzed jointly. As a result, a high-resolution 3-D P-wave velocity model down to 700-km depth is determined, which clearly shows that the Philippine Sea (PHS) plate has subducted aseismically down to \$460 km depth under the Japan Sea, Tsushima Strait and East China Sea. The aseismic PHS slab is visible in two areas: one is under the Japan Sea off western Honshu, and the other is under East China Sea off western Kyushu. However, the aseismic PHS slab is not visible between the two areas, where a slab window has formed. The slab window is located beneath the center of the present study region where many teleseismic rays crisscross. Detailed synthetic tests were conducted, which indicate that both the aseismic PHS slab and the slab window are robust features. Using the teleseismic data recorded by the Japanese stations alone, the aseismic PHS slab and the slab window were also revealed (Zhao et al., 2012), though the ray paths in the Japanese data set crisscross less well offshore. The slab window may be caused by the subducted Kyushu-Palau Ridge and Kinan Seamount Chain where the PHS slab may be segmented. Hot mantle upwelling is revealed in the big mantle wedge above the Paciﬁc slab under the present study region, which may have facilitated the formation of the PHS slab window. These novel ﬁndings may shed new light on the subduction history of the PHS plate and the dynamic evolution of the Japan subduction zone.},

The PmP data are collected from original seismograms of the Kumamoto aftershocks and other local crustal events in Kyushu. Detailed resolution tests show that the addition of the PmP data can signiﬁcantly improve the resolution of the crustal tomography, especially that of the lower crust. Our results show that signiﬁcant low-velocity (low-V) anomalies exist in the entire crust beneath the active volcanoes, which may reﬂect the pathway of arc magma. The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake occurred at the edge of a small low-V zone in the upper crust. A signiﬁcant low-V anomaly is revealed in the lower crust beneath the source zone, which may reﬂect the arc magma and ﬂuids ascending from the mantle wedge.

	abstract = {Lithospheric plates descend into the mantle and drive mantle upwelling in subduction zones, causing large earthquakes and vigorous magmatism along island arcs and continental margins. These processes induce different stress and strain regimes at different depths and generate varying seismic anisotropies. Hence, measurements of seismic anisotropy provide straightforward constraints on the subduction processes, in particular, mantle convection in subduction zones. High-resolution images of seismic anisotropy tomography obtained in the past decade have provided essential and direct information on the anisotropy in subduction zones. These new findings well constrain deformations in the overriding plates, subducting slabs, and mantle flows adjacent to the slabs. The anisotropy in the slabs, either trench-normal or trench-parallel, changes at different depths, reflecting either frozen-in fossil anisotropy or current slab deformations accompanying subduction. In the mantle wedge, dominant trench-normal anisotropy arises from extensive corner flow caused by the subduction, with notable 3D flow and trench-parallel anisotropy due to along-arc variations. In the subduction channel, trench-parallel and subduction-parallel anisotropies are revealed in strong and weak coupling areas, respectively. In the sub-slab mantle, there is still debate on entrained flow caused by subduction (inducing trench-normal anisotropy) and 3D flow caused by trench retreat (inducing trench-parallel anisotropy).},

An updated three-dimensional velocity model signiﬁcantly reduced the travel-time residuals in the earthquake relocation. We found that the large thrust earthquakes are generally located in or around high-velocity patches, suggesting that the generation of the large thrust earthquakes is controlled by structural heterogeneities in the megathrust zone. The high-velocity patches may represent asperities in the megathrust zone where the subducting Paciﬁc plate and the overriding Okhotsk plate may be coupled strongly. Many non-thrust earthquakes occurred in the crust of the overriding Okhotsk plate, indicating that the stress ﬁeld there has been changed by the Tohoku-oki mainshock. The present results may improve our understanding of the subduction dynamics and seismotectonics of the Northeast Japan arc.},

Signiﬁcant lateral variations of seismic velocity are visible in the megathrust zone, and most large interplate thrust earthquakes are found to occur in high-velocity (high-V) areas. These high-V zones may represent high-strength asperities at the plate interface where the subducting Paciﬁc plate and the overriding Okhotsk plate are coupled strongly. A shallow high-V zone with large coseismic slip near the Japan Trench may account for the mainshock asperity of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. Because it is an isolated asperity surrounded by low-velocity patches, most stress on it was released in a short time and the plate interface became decoupled after the Mw 9.0 earthquake. Thus the overriding Okhotsk plate there was shot out toward the Japan Trench and caused the huge tsunami.},

	abstract = {Much progress has been made on revealing seismic structure and mantle dynamics beneath the United States (US) with the EarthScope/USArray project. Seismic anisotropy revealed by shear-wave splitting studies provides important constraints on constructing geodynamic models with regard to the seismic images, but the shear-wave splitting observations have poor vertical resolution and so their interpretations are often not unique. In this work we used a large number of arrival-time data from local and distant earthquakes recorded by the USArray to determine the ﬁrst P-wave azimuthal anisotropy tomography of the crust and upper mantle beneath the US. Our results show that fast velocity directions (FVDs) in the lithosphere under the tectonically active areas correlate well with the surface tectonic features, suggesting that the P-wave anisotropy mainly reﬂects the present deformation. A circular pattern of the FVDs centered in the Great Basin is revealed, which is well consistent with the speciﬁc circular shear-wave splitting observations there, suggesting that the anisotropy occurs in the crust and uppermost mantle. In contrast, beneath the stable cratonic region, the FVDs revealed by this study differ from the shear-wave splitting observations but consistent with the features of gravity and magnetic anomalies, indicating that the P-wave FVDs mainly reﬂect the fossil anisotropy in the lithosphere, whereas the Swave splitting observations mainly reﬂect the signiﬁcant anisotropy in the asthenosphere. The present results shed new light on the seismic anisotropy in the crust and upper mantle and provide new constraints on constructing geodynamic models beneath the US.},

	abstract = {The tectonic evolution of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau is key to understanding the mechanism of growth of the whole Tibetan Plateau. Its imprint on lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle rock fabrics is expected to have a strong signature on seismic anisotropy. In this study, we measure the splitting delays and fast polarization directions (FPD) with the minimum-transverse-energy and the splitting intensity methods using core-refracted phases (e.g., SKS, SKKS, PKS) recorded by the ChinArray experiment. The potential complex anisotropic struc­ tures, i.e., the frequency-dependent splitting and two-layer anisotropy, are investigated in particular. The FPDs are consistent in different frequency bands, but the delay times measured at low frequency (8–20 s) are often larger than those measured at high frequency (2–8 s). The measurements can be better explained by a two-layer anisotropy model at many stations. Splitting intensities are also inverted to constrain the depth distribution of seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle. Combined with the two-layer anisotropy models, these results suggest different patterns of seismic anisotropy in the lithosphere and asthenosphere. In the lithosphere, anisotropy shows distinct patterns in the different tectonic blocks, while the FPDs are oriented along the major tectonic boundaries. In the asthenosphere, continuous NW-SE FPDs spread from the Tibetan plateau to the Youjiang Orogen along the southwestern margin of the Yangtze craton, implying asthenospheric extrusion from the high plateau. In the northern Indochina block, the dominant E-W FPDs may indicate asthenospheric flow driven by the eastern subduction and subsequent rollback of the Indian plate.},

In contrast, the axes of the maximum and intermediate stresses (σ1 and σ2) trend WSW‐ENE to E‐W with wide ranges.

The friction coefﬁcient of the faults is estimated to be relatively small ({\textasciitilde}0.4), indicating that the seismogenic faults in central Kyushu are weak.

P-wave relative travel-time residuals recorded by 17 recently deployed portable seismic stations were manually picked and inverted for three-dimensional upper-mantle and mantle transition-zone tomographic images beneath the ORZ and its adjacent areas. High-velocity anomalies probably representing cratonic lithosphere are visible under the Congo and Kalahari cratons, extending to depths of {\textasciitilde}250–350 km. The tectonic boundary of the Congo craton is observed along the western edge of the ORZ. A localized low-velocity anomaly of about –1\% in magnitude is revealed in the upper astheno­sphere beneath the ORZ, which is interpreted to represent decompression melting induced by lithospheric thinning. The results support the notion that the initiation and early-stage development of the ORZ are mostly due to lithospheric stretching resulted from the relative motion between the Archean Congo and Kalahari cratons along preexisting ancient orogenic zones.},

	abstract = {The Indian plate began to subduct under the Eurasian plate in the late Mesozoic. Since the Eocene, continuous continental collision has resulted in the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau with extensive volcanic activities. Geophysical and geochemical studies have suggested that the Indian plate subducted and that volcanism originated in the deep upper mantle. However, the depth range of the subduction and volcanism and the relationship between them are still unclear. Here, to image the mantle transition zone (MTZ) structures, we deployed new seismic stations and collected as much seismic data as possible from the Tibetan Plateau. We then calculated the receiver functions and analyzed them using the common conversion point stacking method. We found that the MTZ is thickened by {\textasciitilde}20 km under the Lhasa block, where high-velocity anomalies are obvious in the MTZ. Apparent thinning of the MTZ by {\textasciitilde}20 km was revealed under the Qiangtang and Songpan-Ganze blocks, confirming a component of depleted mid-oceanic ridge basalt in the magmatic rocks. Our results suggest that the Indian Plate has at least subducted to the MTZ, which has further induced mantle upwelling and volcanism in the Tibetan Plateau.},

Then, this region was dominated by extensional tectonics due to the farﬁeld effect of the India–Eurasia collision in the Cenozoic. We deployed a portable broad-band seismic array in this region to investigate the crustal structure by using receiver functions. Integrated with regional geophysical and geological characteristics, the analysis of the receiver functions reveals that, the Moho is 32–37 km, 25–41 km, and \$ 41 km depth beneath the northern Qinling terrane, the WG, and the southern margin of the Ordos block, respectively. The Moho depth increases beneath the southern boundary of the WG, while decreases \$10–15 km beneath the northern boundary of the WG. The Moho discontinuity beneath the WG is not a fully mirror image of the crystalline basement, because the thickest sediments (\$10 km) is in the south of the WG. The crustal structure in this region reveals how the crust responds to the tectonic regime transformation. The effect of the Cenozoic crustal extension was topdown. However, the Cenozoic crustal extension has limited effect on the Moho deformation. We suggested that the compressional tectonics before the Cenozoic dominated the lateral variation of the Moho.

Two high‐V bodies appear in the mantle transition zone (410‐ to 660‐km depths) beneath the Interior Low Plateaus, the central Great Plains, and the Central Lowland, which may reﬂect the subducted Farallon plate or delaminated lithosphere.

We find low-velocity anomalies in the upper and lower crust whereas high-velocity anomalies between them; large earthquakes are spatially related to the low-velocity anomalies in the lower crust. The results indicate that the southern margin of the Sichuan Basin has been weakened laterally by the deep crustal extrusion related to the expansion of the SE Tibetan Plateau.

To avoid possible sidelobes of the Moho caused by the deconvolution in the S-receiver function method, we skipped the deconvolution and used the SV onset time as reference time instead of the time of the deconvolution spike. With this new method the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is observed near 80 km depth below both the North and the South China cratons. However, at the north-eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau the LAB is observed at about 160 km depth, smoothly shallowing towards the west and abruptly ending at the western end of the North China Craton. This structure is not visible in traditional S-receiver function data because it is overwhelmed by Moho sidelobes. There is no indication of a deeper (near 200 km) cratonic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in the other parts of the China cratons as it is observed in other cratons. We hypothesise that at the north-eastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau the original thickening of the lithosphere towards the craton is preserved whereas in most parts of the North and South China Cratons the lower part of the lithosphere is removed by some mechanism. The Moho is well observed. It deepens from 30 to 40 km at the sea shores in the east to 60–70 km below eastern Tibetan Plateau.},

Here we applied the harmonic decomposition approach and further conducted a Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) inversion to analyze the crustal anisotropy from receiver functions using waveforms recorded by dense stations in the SE Tibetan plateau. More spatial details on the crustal anisotropy and interface are determined consequently. While the anisotropies in the upper crust are relatively weak ({\textasciitilde}2\%), the anisotropies in the mid-lower crust are mostly stronger than 4\%. The fast polarization directions (FPDs) in the mid-lower crust show a dominant circular pattern, in good coherence with the topographic contours, indicating that the crustal deformations in the SE Tibetan plateau may be mainly controlled by the gravity potential. Because of the significant Moho steps along the plateau margin, the extruded deep crustal materials are blocked by the strong crust around so that the minerals are aligned to be sub-parallel to the plateau margins.},

The results suggest dominant thrust and strike-slip faulting environments in the NE Tibetan Plateau. From the Qilian thrust belt to the Qinling orogen, the maximum horizontal stress orientations (SH ) rotate clockwise from NNE to NE, and further to EW, showing a fan-shaped pattern. The derived minimum horizontal stress orientations (Sh) are parallel to the aligned fabrics in the mantle lithosphere indicated by shear wave splitting measurements, suggesting vertically coherent deformation in the NE Tibetan Plateau. Beneath the SW Qinling adjacent to the plateau, however, the stress orientations in the shallow and deep crust are different, whereas the deep crustal stress ﬁeld indicates possible ductile crustal ﬂow or shear.},

Our results show that the high‐Vp Paciﬁc slab has subducted down to 450‐ to 500‐km depths. A prominent slab gap is revealed at depths of 65–120 km near the Wrangell volcanic ﬁeld, which is likely a slab tear acting as a channel that provides ascending mantle materials to generate magmas feeding the surface volcanoes. In the back‐arc mantle wedge near the eastern slab edge, the AAN exhibits trench‐parallel fast‐velocity directions (FVDs), which may reﬂect along‐strike mantle ﬂow. The FVDs in the subducting Paciﬁc slab are nearly east‐west, which may indicate fossil anisotropy formed at the mid‐ocean ridge. A negative RAN is revealed within the subducting slab, which may be caused by the fast plate subduction with a steep dip angle. Trench‐normal FVDs of the AAN are revealed in the mantle below the Paciﬁc slab, which may reﬂect mantle ﬂow entrained by the subducting slab. A positive RAN is revealed in the mantle beneath the Yakutat slab, indicating that its shallow subduction ﬂattens the mantle ﬂow below the slab to be subhorizontal.

Anisotropic schemes of the pseudo-bending technique and Snell’s law are derived and used iteratively to ﬁnd the fastest ray trajectory. Many synthetic tests are performed to evaluate the accuracy of our algorithm and investigate the raypath differences between the 3-D isotropic and anisotropic rays. The test results show that the travel time and raypath differences are smaller than 0.1 s and 10 km, respectively. Applying our technique to a model of radial anisotropy tomography of the Japan subduction zone, we ﬁnd visible travel time and raypath differences due to variations of the 3-D isotropic velocity and radial anisotropy, but the travel time difference caused by the radial anisotropy is generally {\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.1 s and the raypath difference is generally {\textless}20 km. Two models of Vp radial anisotropy tomography under Japan are obtained using the isotropic and anisotropic ray tracing codes. The two models are very similar to each other, and they have only small differences ({\textless}0.5\%) in the amplitudes of isotropic velocity and radial anisotropy. Considering the limited resolution of the current anisotropic tomography models and the effects of damping and smoothing regularizations, the use of the conventional isotropic ray tracing techniques is acceptable at this stage. However, for high-resolution models of anisotropic tomography in the near future, the 3-D anisotropic ray tracing will be necessary.},

	abstract = {Southeast Asia is surrounded by subduction zones resulting from the interactions of several lithospheric plates. Its evolution has been also inﬂuenced by active tectonics due to the Indo-Asian collision in the Cenozoic. In this study, we use a large number of arrival-time data of local and regional earthquakes to determine 3-D P wave tomography and azimuthal anisotropy in the mantle beneath SE Asia. High-velocity (high-V) anomalies representing the subducting slabs are clearly visible in the upper mantle and the mantle transition zone (MTZ). Low-velocity (low-V) zones with trench-normal anisotropy are revealed in the uppermost mantle, which indicate back-arc spreading or secondary mantle-wedge ﬂow induced by the slab subduction. In contrast, trench-parallel anisotropy dominates in the deep upper mantle and reﬂects structures either in the subducting slab or in the upper mantle surrounding the slab. The trench-parallel anisotropy is also signiﬁcant in the lower MTZ, which may contribute to shear wave splitting observations. A low-V body extending down to the lower mantle is visible under the Hainan volcano far away from the plate boundaries, suggesting that Hainan is a hot spot fed by a lower-mantle plume. The low-V body under Hainan is connected with low-V zones in the upper mantle under SE Tibet and Vietnam. Our P wave anisotropy results reﬂect signiﬁcant mantle ﬂow existing in the asthenosphere from SE Tibet to Hainan and further southwestward to Vietnam. The present study, especially the 3-D P wave anisotropy results, provides important new insight into mantle dynamics in SE Asia.},

	abstract = {P wave tomography has been recently used to study 3-D azimuthal and radial anisotropy of subduction zones and continental regions. However, the fundamental issue about the trade-off between the isotropic and anisotropic structures is still unclear. In this study, we investigate this issue systematically with comprehensive synthetic tests. Our results indicate that good ray coverage in the azimuth (for azimuthal anisotropy) and incidence (for radial anisotropy) is required for determining reliable anisotropic models. The isotropic and anisotropic structures are strongly coupled, and smearing effects are signiﬁcant when the rays used in the inversion are limited in a small range of azimuth or incidence. We therefore plot ray azimuth and ray incidence ellipses at every grid nodes and propose to use the normalized length of the short axis (i.e., the ratio of the short-axis and long-axis lengths) for estimating the ray coverage quantitatively. Applying our novel approach to a large number of high-quality arrival time data of local shallow- and intermediate-depth earthquakes, we obtained new tomographic images of 3-D P wave azimuthal and radial anisotropy in Northeast Japan. Both the azimuthal and radial anisotropy results are determined reliably for the shallow parts of the study region, whereas the smearing effects are signiﬁcant in the deeper part of the mantle wedge and the subducting slab. Our results show dominant trench-normal and vertical-fast anisotropy in the mantle wedge while trench-parallel and horizontal-fast anisotropy in the subducting slab, which indicates different dynamics in different domains of the subduction zone.},

In this study, we measured SKS splitting from 114 portable stations to reveal the complicated deformation of the upper mantle under western Mongolia. The predominant NW-SE-oriented fast polarization directions (FPDs) are consistent with lithospheric deformation and asthenospheric flow to the first order. However, the FPDs of the stations close to the Siberian Craton are more parallel to the cratonic margin than those departing from the craton. It indicates that the shape of the rigid Siberian Craton may determine the extent of the present lithospheric deformation and cause the deflection of the asthenospheric flow. Large SKS splitting delay times are distributed in the Hovsgol rift and Gobi-Altai range, implying superimposed past and present lithospheric anisotropy, and the asthenospheric anisotropy as well under the Hovsgol rift. Small delay times in the Hangai Dome indicate the asthenospheric upwelling which causes the uplift of the dome.},

Our images also reveal low-velocity anomalies under the Hangai Dome, probably suggesting the process of delamination, another consequent effect connected to the Siberian upwellings.

We find an annular high-velocity zone in the lithosphere; whereas low-velocity anomalies exist both inside and around the high-velocity ring as well as beneath the rift zone. Strong interactions between the high-velocity ring and the surrounding terranes may have induced many moderate-to-large earthquakes (Mw 5–7). By contrast, mega-earthquakes (Mw ≥ 8.0) occurred right above the high-velocity ring. We propose that the high-velocity ring is strong as a whole; it sustains the stress arising from the India-Asia collision and causes the mega-earthquakes.

Our results show that the hydration degree of the lower plate is high in the Shumagin Gap but relatively low in the Semidi and Kodiak segments, which roughly shows a trend of eastward decrease that is correlated with an increase of the interseismic slip deficit rate. The variation of slab serpentinization degree derived from our Vp model shows an uneven decreasing trend, well consistent with the along-strike segmentation of interplate coupling and coseismic slip distributions of the 2020 Mw 7.8 Simeonof and 2021 Mw 8.2 Chignik megathrust earthquakes. The 2020 Mw 7.6 Sand Point earthquake took place within the strongly hydrated slab, whose occurrence was probably related to the variation of slip deficit rate that is probably affected by the changes in plate hydration. In addition, slow earthquakes occurred between the hydrated slab with pre-subduction structures (e.g., bending faults, seamounts, and fracture zones) and the fluid-saturated overriding crust and mantle wedge, where the intraslab seismicity and dehydration are intensive. These features suggest that lower-plate hydration and dehydration may affect the interplate coupling and seismogenic behaviors in subduction zones.},

Here, we employ a grid search approach to simultaneously extract the bulk crustal azimuthal anisotropy and Moho orientation using receiver functions. The solution of this approach is the weighted average of two individual subfunctions that separately analyze the birefringence and arrival time of the Pms phase. Since a tilted Moho deﬂects the polarized components of the Pms phase, the Pms birefringence subfunction minimizes the energy on all the transverse polarization components (i.e., the transverse polarization direction before Pms splitting). The implementation of this subfunction is similar to that of the transverse component minimization method, but the Moho orientation is considered. The Pms arrival time subfunction takes into account both the crustal anisotropy and the Moho orientation to predict and ﬁt Pms arrivals. According to extensive synthetic experiments, this approach is remarkably robust to the presence of strong anisotropy, a steep Moho, and slightly tilted fast axes (less than 30°). This approach is also highly tolerant of random noise and data with uneven azimuthal coverage. We apply this approach to three permanent stations on the Tibetan Plateau. The resulting measurements boast a high quality and are consistent with the crustal anisotropy and Moho orientation revealed in previous studies.},

We investigate lithospheric structures, in particular the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), of Central Tien Shan (CTS) using S wave receiver functions. The results show distinct structures across the orogen. Under the southern CTS, the LAB is shallower than that of the Tarim Basin; a 50 km vertical offset implies that part of the lithosphere has been delaminated. Under the middle CTS, two phases of negative velocity gradient are obtained, which may indicate a new LAB and an ongoing delamination underneath. Under the northern CTS and Kazakh Shield northward, the lithosphere is stable although the LAB inclines southward slightly. The two periods of lithospheric delamination under the southern and middle CTS account well for pulsed uplifts of the Tien Shan at {\textasciitilde}11-8 Ma and {\textasciitilde}5-0 Ma, respectively.},

We interpret this depressed Moho zone as a relict of the thickened crustal root formed during the intracontinental orogeny in late Mesozoic. The Cenozoic rift has not yet reequilibrated the crustal-mantle boundary possibly due to the lack of decompressional melting during the lithospheric extension.},

	abstract = {East-central China has experienced multi-stage evolution among different tectonic units; thus the present geological structures are superimposed in a long history. But it is still unclear how different tectonic processes interact with each other, especially how the subsequent activity affects the previous structures. In this study, we determined new high-resolution P and S wave tomography of the upper mantle beneath the east-central China. We imaged the stagnant Pacific slab in the mantle transition zone and the hot low-velocity upper mantle in eastern China while cold high-velocity bodies beneath the Archean cratons in central China. More importantly, we newly revealed two important features. Firstly, a high-velocity zone is found in the uppermost mantle (50–150 km) beneath the Southeast China; its location is comparable to the distribution of the Cretaceous igneous rocks. Thus, we propose that the high-velocity anomalies reflect the remnant mafic rocks in the upper mantle after the volcanic eruption. Secondly, a high-velocity body is revealed in the deep upper mantle (300–500 km) beneath the southwestern Yangtze craton, possibly implying the delaminated cratonic lithosphere in the Early Mesozoic.},

	abstract = {The Ailaoshan Red River shear zone (ARSZ) was formed in the Mesozoic as a suture zone between the Indochina block and the Yangtze craton. Since the Cenozoic, block extrusion due to the Indo-Asian collision has reactivated the fault zone and caused large-scale shearing. Affected by the Cenozoic orogeny, a large volume of magmatic and metamorphic rocks developed in the ARSZ, forming many orogenic gold deposits. However, the source and the geodynamic process of these magmatic activities are still unclear. To gain a basic understanding of the subsurface magmatic activity, we deployed a dense array of 24 broadband seismic stations across the Daping and Chang'an gold deposits at the southern end of the ARSZ. Receiver function analysis, common conversion point stacking, and a joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersions are performed to image the detailed structure of the crust and uppermost mantle. Low-velocity zones in the mid-lower crust and thinned lithosphere (∼70 km) are imaged under the ARSZ. The observed subsurface structures are verified by 3D numerical modeling with the SEM-FK method. We speculate that the mantle upwelling caused by lithospheric delamination has provided the main source of the mantle component in the magmatic rocks since ∼35 Ma; afterward, high temperatures produced partial melting in the lower crust, which was emplaced along active shear zones.},

Middle‐lower crustal ﬂow is a popular model to interpret the geodynamic mechanism on the margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The model predicts different surface and Moho topographies across the plateau boundary due to the different strengths of the surrounding blocks, that is, sharp boundaries on the eastern plateau boundary and gentle variations in the southeastern plateau boundary. Here, we employ receiver function and common conversion point stacking analysis with the seismic waveforms recorded by the dense ChinArray and other local seismic stations to accurately deﬁne the Moho topography in southeastern (SE) Tibet. We ﬁnd that the Moho under the Tibetan Plateau is much deeper than that under the surrounding Yangtze Craton and Indochina block; abrupt Moho changes are found across the southeastern plateau margin, similar to that under the eastern plateau margin. We interpret these sharp Moho variations across the plateau margin to have developed when the Tibetan Plateau was extruded southeastward in the late Miocene. Subsequent gravity collapse resulted in crustal extension and gentle topographic variation, while the sharp Moho slope was preserved.},

	abstract = {Compressional and extensional tectonics following northward plate convergences since the Miocene have formed the major surface features in Turkey, such as faulting and orogeny. Despite increasing efforts in last few decades aiming to elucidate the current architecture of the crust and mantle beneath Turkey, several issues regarding the depth extent of the deformation zones, crust‐mantle interaction (e.g., coupling and decoupling) in relation to the deformation, and stress transmission in the lithosphere remain elusive. Here we present high‐resolution 3‐D P wave isotropic and azimuthal anisotropic velocity models of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath Turkey by inverting 204,531 P wave arrival times of 8,103 local crustal earthquakes. Our results reveal low‐velocity anomalies or velocity contrasts down to the uppermost mantle along the North and East Anatolian Fault Zones. The fast velocity directions (FVDs) of azimuthal anisotropy in the lower crust and uppermost mantle are parallel to the regional maximum extensional directions in western Turkey, and the FVDs in the crust and uppermost mantle are parallel to the surface structures in southeastern Turkey. These results indicate that vertically coherent deformation between the crust and uppermost mantle occurs in western and southeastern Turkey. However, in central northern Turkey, the FVDs in the uppermost mantle are oblique to both the FVDs in the lower crust and the maximum shear directions derived from GPS measurements, suggesting that the crust and lithospheric mantle are decoupled there.},

In this work we study the 3‐D seismic structures (Vp, Vs, and Poisson's ratio) in and around the source zones of the 2018 Anchorage intraslab earthquake (Mw 7.1) and the 1964 Alaska megathrust earthquake (Mw 9.2). The Anchorage earthquake occurred in an anomalous zone within the subducting Yakutat/Paciﬁc plate with a higher Poisson's ratio than the normal slab. Above the source zone, the overriding North American plate shows a low Vs and a high Poisson's ratio. These features indicate that strong dehydration occurs in the source zone and released ﬂuids ascend into the overlying crust. Two areas with long‐term slow slip events in the Upper and Lower Cook Inlet predominantly exhibit a high Poisson's ratio in the lowermost portion of the crust and the cold nose of the mantle wedge, whereas a low Poisson's ratio zone is revealed between them, suggesting that their segmentation is possibly related to localized slab‐releasing ﬂuids. In the Prince William Sound, the rupture of the 1964 Great Alaska earthquake initiated beneath a high‐V and high Poisson's ratio zone of the overlying crust and the large slips occurred beneath a low‐Vs and high Poisson's ratio zone, suggesting that lateral heterogeneities of the overriding plate may have played an important role in the nucleation and rupture processes of the Great Alaska earthquake.},

	abstract = {Tectonics in Northeast Asia are characterized as the deep subduction of the Paciﬁc Plate and the induced volcanism in Northeast China. Seismic anisotropy due to deformations is essential for understanding the mantle dynamics. However, the routine SKS splitting captures the accumulated seismic anisotropy from core‐mantle boundary to the surface, so the interpretation of the SKS splitting measurements is nonunique. Here, beneﬁting from abundant deep‐focus earthquakes in the subducting Paciﬁc Plate, we measured shear wave splitting using both the SKS and local S waves recorded at Station MDJ to discriminate the anisotropy at different depths under Northeast China. We obtained 61 SKS and 22 local S wave splitting parameters. The SKS splitting measurements show apparent azimuthal variations that can be modeled by two‐layer anisotropy. The fast polarization directions (FPDs) of anisotropy in the upper and lower layers are NE‐SW and NW‐SE, which may be explained by the lithospheric deformation accompanying the Mesozoic fault activity and the asthenospheric deformation due to motion of the Eurasian Plate, respectively. The FPDs of the local S wave splitting measurements are parallel to the direction of the Paciﬁc Plate subduction; the variation of the delay times is related to the take‐off angles. The observations can be explained by the inclined symmetry axis of the aligned metastable olivine in the subducting Paciﬁc Plate.},

Our results indicate different deformation patterns in the overriding lithosphere, mantle wedge, and the subducting Nazca slab as well as signiﬁcant along‐arc variations. Radiating fast velocity directions (FVDs) around the rupture zone of the 2014 Iquique earthquake (Mw 8.2) are notable in the crust, which may reﬂect the speciﬁc crustal extension induced by a point‐like stress source in the form of a fully locked asperity at the plate interface. In most of the study region, FVDs in the mantle wedge are trench normal, which we interpret to have resulted from mantle wedge ﬂow driven by the oceanic plate subduction. However, trench‐parallel FVDs are found beneath the northern segment, which may imply the occurrence of B‐type olivine fabrics in the cold forearc mantle. Strong along‐arc variations are also observed in the subducting slab, which may reﬂect intraslab heterogeneity and change in the slab geometry. In the northern segment, slab bending induces generally trench‐normal extension and leads to trench‐normal FVDs in the upper part of the slab. In contrast, in the southern segment, ﬂat slab subduction and thus slab unbending dominate, producing trench‐normal compression and trench‐parallel FVDs instead. Along the subducting slab interface, FVDs change from trench‐parallel to trench‐normal in the downdip direction, which may indicate the ﬁrst‐order transition from compression in the locking area to dominant shear in the decoupling area along the slab interface.},

However, interactions between the plateau and its adjacent subduction zone and craton are still unclear. In this study, we determine updated high‐resolution P and S wave tomographic models of the crust and upper mantle beneath the SE Tibetan Plateau. We conﬁrmed the existence of a high‐velocity layer in the upper mantle down to 200‐km depth beneath the Sichuan basin, the core of the Yangtze craton, representing the stable cratonic root. Another high‐velocity body is located beneath Burma, reﬂecting the subducting Indian slab in the upper mantle and possibly the remnant Burman slab in the mantle transition zone. A strong low‐velocity column exists above the high‐velocity body in the transition zone and reaches the Moho under the Tengchong volcano. In addition, we ﬁnd high‐velocity fragments in the upper mantle beneath the Yangtze craton and northern Indochina, which may reﬂect delaminated lithosphere beneath the SE Tibetan Plateau. The lithospheric delamination may be closely related to mantle ﬂow extruded from the high plateau and possible thermal upwelling from the lower mantle. Our results provide new insight into the deep interactions between the Tibetan plateau and its surrounding blocks near the SE plateau margin.},

In this study we present a high-resolution three-dimensional model of P wave velocity tomography and azimuthal anisotropy in the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the SE Tibetan Plateau determined using traveltime data recorded by a dense seismic network. Widespread low-velocity zones are revealed around a high-velocity body in the deep crust and uppermost mantle beneath the southwest Yangtze Craton, where fast-velocity directions of the azimuthal anisotropy are mostly parallel to the contour lines of the surface topography and the Moho depth along the plateau margin. These results indicate that gravitational potential plays an important role in the crustal and uppermost-mantle deformations in the SE Tibetan Plateau. Meanwhile, the shallow crust may drop down to the deep crust and drive the ductile deep-crustal material to intrude into the adjacent regions. The extruded crust is trapped in a deep-crustal corner and obstructed by the surrounding strong blocks. The trapped crustal material may rise up, causing signiﬁcant uplift and high heat ﬂow at the surface.},

	abstract = {Seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle beneath East Asia has been studied extensively using shear wave (SKS) splitting measurements, which have provided important information on mantle dynamics in this region. However, SKS measurements have poor vertical resolution, and so their interpretations are usually not unique. In this work we use a large number of traveltime data from 34,036 local earthquakes recorded by 1563 seismic stations to determine the ﬁrst model of 3-D P wave azimuthal anisotropy in the lithosphere beneath China. Our results show that the fast velocity directions (FVDs) are generally correlated with the surface geologic features, such as the strikes of the orogens, active faults, and tectonic boundaries. The FVDs in the upper crust are normal to the maximal horizontal stress (σH) in regions with extensive compression such as the Tibetan Plateau, whereas they are subparallel to σH in strike-slip shear zones such as the western and eastern Himalayan syntax. The comparison of the FVDs of P wave anisotropy with SKS splitting measurements indicates that beneath the Tibetan Plateau the seismic anisotropy in the lithosphere contributes signiﬁcantly to the SKS splitting observations. In contrast, in east China the P wave FVDs in the lithosphere are different from the SKS splitting measurements, suggesting that the SKS splitting is mainly caused by the anisotropy in the deeper mantle such as the asthenosphere and the mantle transition zone under east China. These novel results provide important new information on the lithospheric deformation and mantle dynamics in East Asia.},

	abstract = {To understand the seismotectonics in the eastern margin of the Japan Sea, we determined the ﬁrst highresolution 3-D P-wave velocity structure and azimuthal anisotropy under the Japan Sea off Northeast Japan using 175,425 high-precision P-wave arrival times from 2833 local earthquakes recorded by 330 seismograph stations. P-wave arrival times from 145 suboceanic earthquakes relocated with sP depth phase are crucial to determine the structure of the crust and uppermost mantle under the Japan Sea. Our results show that strong velocity variations exist in the crust and uppermost mantle under the eastern margin of the Japan Sea. Many large crustal earthquakes occurred in or around low-velocity zones which may represent weak sections of the seismogenic crust. The P-wave azimuthal anisotropy is complex under the Japan Sea, which may also indicate the complex crustal structures there. In the eastern margin of the Japan Sea, the strong heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle revealed by seismic tomography may reﬂect the complicated geologic structures such as the alternate rift zones, ridges, basins, horsts, grabens, volcanics, and continental fragments which were produced during the back-arc spreading, opening of the Japan Sea and the present compressional stage of the Honshu arc.},

	abstract = {Seismic anisotropy in the East Japan arc has been extensively investigated by conducting shear-wave splitting measurements, receiver-function analyses, and tomographic inversions of body-wave travel times and surfacewave dispersion data, which have provided a wealth of information on dynamic processes associated with active subduction of the Pacific plate. Measuring shear-wave splitting is popular and effective to detect seismic anisotropy, but it has poor depth resolution. This problem has been overcome by conducting 3-D anisotropic tomography, which has high-resolution in both lateral and vertical directions. Both P and S wave anisotropies are revealed in the crust, which are caused by alignment or preferred orientation of crustal minerals and stressinduced microcracks related to active faults. Trench-normal fast-velocity directions (FVDs) of azimuthal anisotropy are revealed in the back-arc mantle wedge, reflecting subduction-driven convection there. Trenchparallel FVDs appear in the forearc mantle wedge under the land area, which may reflect deformation that re­ sults in B-type olivine fabric. The forearc mantle wedge offshore may lack anisotropy, suggesting that it is stagnant and decoupled from the subducting slab and does not participate in the viscous flow, in sharp contrast with the rest of the mantle wedge. The most significant findings of the body-wave anisotropic tomography are its constraints on the slab anisotropy. The subducting Pacific slab exhibits mainly trench-parallel FVDs, which reflect shape-preferred orientation of crystals and cracks related to normal faults produced in the outer-rise area before the plate subduction, overprinting the fossil anisotropy that the Pacific plate gained when it was produced at the mid-ocean ridge. Trench-parallel intraslab fast velocity planes of anisotropy intersect the slab upper surface at high angles ({\textasciitilde}45–90◦), reflecting aligned hydrated faults in the slab. Ruptures of the hydrated faults in the upper part of the slab may cause large intraslab earthquakes (M ≥7.0) that take place frequently beneath the forearc area. Trench-normal FVDs also appear in the subslab mantle, which may reflect asthenospheric shear deformation associated with the overlying slab subduction.},
