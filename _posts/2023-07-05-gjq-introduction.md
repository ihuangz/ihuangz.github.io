Jiaqi first gave a simple lecture to introduce seismology briefly to high school students who visited Nanjing University and are interested in earth sciences.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/gjq-xianlin.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>



Afterwards, Jiaqi and the students went around the broad-band seismic station in Xinlin Campus and jumped together strongly to observe the real-time waveforms displayed in the monitor. The students were excited when seeing the "earthquake" they produced.
