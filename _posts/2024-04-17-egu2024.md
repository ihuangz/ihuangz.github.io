JI Cong focused on orals and posters related to the Adria plate, deep structures and dynamics of the SE Tibet and North China Craton, ambient noise, and methods based on receiver functions. The interactions with domestic and international scholars were beneficial, and he looks forward to presenting a poster or oral next year.
