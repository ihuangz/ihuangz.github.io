Ji Cong attended the CSRM Meeting held in USTC, Hefei. This meeting discussed the newly published China Seismological Reference Model (CSRM), including the Moho depth, Vp/Vs ratio, Pn velocity, and an integrated model of multiple parameters of the crust and uppermost mantle of China. Further, some results based on this reference model were presented and the system for data exchange was discussed.


 The CSRM can be achieved online after a simple application on http://chinageorefmodel.org/. The data can be used as a reference model and also the starting model for inversion for further study.
