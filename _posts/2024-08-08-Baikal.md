During 17-31 July, 2024, I took part in a field trip in Lake Baikal with 32 students and teachers of Nanjing University. It is five years after my last vist in 2019 and 18 years from my first visit in 2006. From a student to a teacher, I have changed much. But the lake is always in my deep mind, in particular its blue is always accompanying me till forever.

The boys and girls are all happy as I was 18 years ago. They will have very bright future.
