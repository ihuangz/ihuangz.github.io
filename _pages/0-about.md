I am a geophysicist at Nanjing University, China. [Email](mailto:huangz@nju.edu.cn) [中文网页]( https://es.nju.edu.cn/hzc/list.htm) 

I obtained my Bachelor degree in Geology in 2006, and the Doctorate degree in Structural Geology in 2011, both from **Nanjing University**. My PhD thesis was awarded as the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Nanjing University and Jiangsu Province, which was also nominated for National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award.

From 2007 to 2012, I visited **Tohoku University**, Japan for several times and spent more than 30 months there, including one-year JSPS G-COE post-doctoral fellowship between September 2011 and August 2012. 

From June 2016 to May 2018, I worked at **German Research Centre GFZ** as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship.  

My research focuses on the structures and deformation of the crust and upper mantle beneath continents and subduction zones using seismology (e.g., seismic tomography, shear-wave splitting, surface wave inversion, receiver functions, focal mechanism solutions). The main findings are summerized as:

- Seismic velocity and anisotropy of the subduction zones (i.e., Japan, Indonisia, and North Chile) reveal different deformations patterns in the crust, mantle wedge, and subducting slabs, as well as their lateral variations. Megathrust earthquakes are found to occur in the anomalous regions on the plate interfaces, which emperized roles of the structural heterogeities on the genesis of earthquakes.
