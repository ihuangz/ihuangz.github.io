I am a geophysicist at Nanjing University, China.

I obtained my Bachelor degree in Geology in 2006, and the Doctorate degree in Structural Geology in 2011, both from **Nanjing University**. My PhD thesis was awarded as the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of Nanjing University and Jiangsu Province, which was also nominated for National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award.

From 2007 to 2012, I visited **Tohoku University**, Japan for several times and spent more than 30 months there, including one-year JSPS G-COE post-doctoral fellowship between September 2011 and August 2012. 

From June 2016 to May 2018, I worked at **German Research Centre GFZ** as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship.  

I study the structures and deformation patterns of the crust and upper mantle with seismology (e.g., seismic tomography, shear-wave splitting, surface wave inversion, receiver functions, focal mechanism solutions). The main topics include:

- Geodynamics beneath subduction zones and continents
- Mechanism of interplate and intracontinental earthquakes
- Growth mechanism  of the Tibetan and Mongolian plateaus

The current projects I am in charge of are:

- Layered  deformation  in the Tibetan margins and their implications for the plateau expansion
- Continental rheology and its control on intracontinental earthquakes and volcanoes
- Searching for paleo-Pacific slabs in the lower mantle under East Asia

I also take part in some works that determine high-resolution near-surface structures under cities and  in areas of mineral deposits
