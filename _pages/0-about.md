I study the structures and deformation patterns of the crust and upper mantle with seismology (e.g., seismic tomography, shear-wave splitting, surface wave inversion, receiver functions, focal mechanism solutions). The main topics include:

- Geodynamics beneath subduction zones and continents
- Mechanism of interplate and intracontinental earthquakes
- Growth mechanism  of the Tibetan and Mongolian plateaus

The current projects I am in charge of are:

- Layered  deformation  in the Tibetan margins and their implications for the plateau expansion
- Continental rheology and its control on intracontinental earthquakes and volcanoes
- Searching for paleo-Pacific slabs in the lower mantle under East Asia

I also take part in some works that determine high-resolution near-surface structures under cities and  in areas of mineral deposits
